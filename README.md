# Fire-Rain-Project

This is a website that visualizes California Wild Fires from 1980 to 2016. Examined whether there is a relationship between severity of wildfires and rainfall. 

The data is stored in a postgresSQL database, converted to JSON format, and served by a Python Flask app. The website includes a page displaying a bubble chart, a map of California created using the Javascript library Leaflet, and a line chart created using Plotly.js.
